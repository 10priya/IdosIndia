               IDOS is a financial platform that enables you to easily manage not just accounting&#44; taxation and financial processes&#44; but empowers you with
               data and curated reports for decision making and analytics&#46; IDOS has been built on the premise that a technology solution must not just
               enable the business to prepare financial statements and file tax returns&#44; which are consequential requirements and not the primary reason
               for which a business is set up&#46; Rather&#44; the technology must empower the business to become profitable through efficiency in operations
               and also by enabling the business to overcome key challenges including working capital management and ensuring reduced cost of sales&#46;
               Further the technology must enable the business to engage effectively with the eco&#45;system in which it operates including its customers&#44;
               suppliers&#44; staff and other stakeholders and such engagement must help the business to generate more profits&#46; This is what IDOS delivers&#44;
               in a simple and user friendly manner&#44; through powerful eco&#45;system engagement and by providing capabilities more than traditional
               accounting softwares and ERPs&#46; IDOS has been built on a disruptive functional architecture which is empowering multiple businesses and
               also professional services providers across the world in their day to day business management&#46;
